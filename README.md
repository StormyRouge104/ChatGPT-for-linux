<p align="center">Recently switched to Linux and tried several ChatGPT apps made by others, but none of them let me log into my account. So I created a minimal Electron wrapper for ChatGPT with tray support and a global shortcut (Alt+Space). No tabs, no address bar â€” just pure ChatGPT. It's lightweight and uses very little RAM. Iâ€™ll keep updating it in the future.
